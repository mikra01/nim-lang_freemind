### nim-lang_freemind
Freemind mindmap of some nim-lang related resources.
I used this a few years ago as a resource / mental hooks 
while learning nim-lang.

Contains code samples, links and unsorted stuff mostly taken
out of forum.nim-lang.org

Unfortunately completely unsorted and needs probably some rework.

PR's welcome
